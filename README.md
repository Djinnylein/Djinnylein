ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Djinnylein

In early 2022 I made my Bachelor of Science with a major on media computer science. Even though I came in contact with many different programming languages in my studies, I also had a part time job, where I worked with PHP and Laravel. And I stayed with PHP and its frameworks.
So, in my fulltime job I still work with PHP, but also with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and their frameworks. And I'm having a blast of fun with it.
